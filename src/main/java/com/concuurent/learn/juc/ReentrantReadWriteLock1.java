 *  解决线程安全问题使用ReentrantLock就可以，但是ReentrantLock是独占锁，
 *  某时只有一个线程可以获取该锁，而实际中会有写少读多的场景，
 *  显然ReentrantLock满足不了这个需求，所以ReentrantReadWriteLock应运而生。
 *  ReentrantReadWriteLock采用读写分离的策略，允许多个线程可以同时获取读锁。
 *  </p>
 *  读写锁的内部维护了一个ReadLock和一个WriteLock，它们依赖Sync实现具体功能而Sync继承自AQS，
 *  并且也提供了公平和非公平的实现。下面只介绍非公平的读写锁实现。我们知道AQS中只维护了一个state状态，
 *  而ReentrantReadWriteLock需要维护读状态和写状态，一个state怎么表示写和读两种状态呢？
 *  ReentrantReadWriteLock巧妙地使用state的高16位表示读状态，也就是获取到读锁的次数；
